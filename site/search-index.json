While they are often associated with web services and cloud platforms today, APIs have a much longer history that parallels the evolution of computing itself.\n\"What is an API?\"\nAn API defines how different software components communicate with each other using well-defined rules and interfaces.\n\n\nEarly Foundations (1960s–1970s)\nIn the earliest days of computing, programs were tightly coupled to hardware. As operating systems matured, system calls emerged as a structured way for applications to request services such as memory allocation, file access, and process control.\nThese system calls are considered the earliest form of APIs. They introduced the idea of abstraction—allowing developers to use system functionality without knowing internal implementation details.\n\"Key Concept\"\nAbstraction allows software to evolve independently from the hardware it runs on.\n\n\nLibrary and OS APIs (1980s)\nWith the rise of personal computers, operating systems began exposing richer APIs to developers. Platforms such as UNIX and Microsoft Windows provided standardized interfaces that allowed third-party applications to interact consistently with the system.\nAt the same time, programming languages shipped with standard libraries, offering reusable functions that further reinforced API-driven development.\n// Example: C standard library usage\nprintf(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n\n\nObject-Oriented and Enterprise APIs (1990s)\nThe adoption of object-oriented programming expanded APIs beyond simple functions to include classes, methods, and interfaces. Languages such as Java popularized large, well-documented API ecosystems.\nEnterprise technologies like COM, CORBA, and later Java EE enabled large-scale system integration across distributed environments.\n\"Why this mattered\"\nReusable APIs reduced duplication and made large systems easier to maintain.\n\n\nThe Rise of Web APIs (2000s)\nThe internet transformed APIs into platform-independent communication tools. Web APIs allowed systems written in different languages to communicate over HTTP.\nA major milestone occurred in 2000 when Roy Fielding introduced REST (Representational State Transfer) in his doctoral dissertation. REST defined principles such as statelessness, resource-based URLs, and standard HTTP methods.\n\nREST ExampleResponse (JSON)GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.example.com\n\n{\n  &quot;id&quot;: 123,\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;\n}\n\n\nModern APIs and Cloud Computing (2010s–Present)\nToday, APIs power cloud platforms, mobile applications, and microservices architectures. Companies expose public APIs to enable integrations, while internal APIs support scalable distributed systems.\nModern API styles include:\n\nREST APIs\nGraphQL APIs\nEvent-driven and streaming APIs\n\ngraph LR;\n    Client --> API;\n    API --> ServiceA;\n    API --> ServiceB;\n\nWhy APIs Matter Today\n\"Strategic Importance\"\nAPIs are no longer just technical tools—they are products, platforms, and business enablers.\n\nAPIs enable faster development, cross-platform compatibility, and innovation by allowing teams to build on existing services instead of reinventing them.\n\nConclusion\nFrom early system calls to modern cloud-based services, APIs have evolved to meet the growing complexity of software systems. Their history reflects a continuous effort to improve abstraction, interoperability, and scalability in computing.\n\nSources 📚\n\nFielding, R. T. (2000).

APIs define how requests and responses should be structured, allowing applications to interact without exposing internal implementation details. This article provides a technical overview of APIs, their purpose, and their role in modern software architecture.\n1. Definition of an API\nAn Application Programming Interface is a set of protocols, rules, and data formats that software components use to communicate. It specifies what operations are available, how to invoke them, and what data is returned. APIs act as a contract between a service provider and a consumer, ensuring consistent and predictable interactions.\n2. How APIs Work\nAt a technical level, APIs operate through a request–response model:\n\nA client sends a request to an API endpoint.\nThe server processes the request according to defined rules.\nThe server returns a response, usually containing data or a status code.\n\nCommon communication methods include HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.\n3. Types of APIs\nAPIs can be categorized based on their usage and accessibility:\n\nWeb APIs: Operate over the internet using HTTP (e.g., REST, GraphQL).\nInternal APIs: Used within an organization to connect internal systems.\nPublic APIs: Exposed to external developers for third-party integration.\nSystem APIs: Provide access to operating system-level functionality.\n\n4. Use Cases in Software Development\nAPIs are fundamental to modern applications. They enable:\n\nIntegration between microservices\nAccess to third-party services such as payment processing, mapping, or authentication\nCross-platform communication between web, mobile, and desktop applications\n\nBy using APIs, developers can build scalable systems and reduce development time through reuse of existing services.\n5. Benefits and Importance\nAPIs offer several technical advantages:\n\nAbstraction: Hide internal complexity\nModularity: Encourage separation of concerns\nScalability: Support distributed system architectures\nMaintainability: Allow systems to evolve independently\n\nConclusion\nAPIs are a core component of modern software engineering. By defining clear and consistent interfaces, they enable interoperability, scalability, and rapid innovation across diverse systems. Understanding APIs is essential for designing and building reliable, maintainable, and extensible software solutions.\n"},"2":{"title":"Branches and Merging (Working Safely with Changes)","id":"git/branches-and-merging/","text":"Branches and Merging (Working Safely with Changes)\nBranches and merging are two of the most powerful ideas in Git, but they can be explained in simple terms.\n\nA branch is like a separate copy of your project’s timeline.\nMerging is how you bring changes from one branch into another.\n\n\nSimple Analogy: Writing a Book with Drafts\nImagine you and your team are writing a book:\n\nThe main branch (main) is the official book everyone trusts.\nYou want to try a new chapter, but you are not sure if it will be good.\n\nInstead of editing the official book directly, you:\n\nMake a copy of the book for experimentation — this is your feature branch.\nEdit the copy safely.\nIf everyone likes your changes, you merge them back into the official book.\n\nThis is exactly what branches and merging do for code.\n\nWhat Is a Branch?\nA branch in Git:\n\nHas its own history of commits\nStarts from another branch (usually main)\nLets you work on changes without affecting the original branch\n\nBy default, your project has a main branch called main (or sometimes master).\nHere is a picture of a simple branching timeline:\ngitGraph\n  commit id: \"Start on main\"\n  commit id: \"More changes on main\"\n  branch feature/login-page\n  checkout feature/login-page\n  commit id: \"Work on login page\"\n  commit id: \"More login improvements\"\n  checkout main\n  commit id: \"Hotfix on main\"\n\nChecking Your Current Branch\nTo see which branch you are on:\ngit status\n\nYou will see something like:\nOn branch main\n\nHere, main is the current branch.\n\nCreating a New Branch\nTo create a new branch, for example for a login feature, run:\ngit checkout -b feature/login-page\n\nThis does two things:\n\nCreates a new branch called feature/login-page\nSwitches you to that branch\n\nNow any changes and commits you make are part of this new branch, not main.\n\nSwitching Between Branches\nTo switch back to the main branch:\ngit checkout main\n\nTo switch again to your feature branch:\ngit checkout feature/login-page\n\nImportant:\nYou should commit or stash your changes before switching branches, otherwise Git may stop you to avoid losing work.\n\nTypical Workflow with a Feature Branch\nHere’s a common flow:\n# 1. Make sure main is up to date\ngit checkout main\ngit pull\n\n# 2. Create and switch to a new branch\ngit checkout -b feature/login-page\n\n# 3. Make changes to files (in your editor)\n\n# 4. Stage and commit your changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;Add basic login page layout&quot;\n\n# 5. Push your branch to the remote\ngit push -u origin feature/login-page\n\nNow your teammates can see your branch and review it (often via a pull request or merge request).\n\nWhat Is Merging?\nMerging means combining the history of one branch into another.\nExample:\n\nYou worked on feature/login-page\nYou want to bring those changes into main\n\nYou will:\n\nGo to the branch that should receive the changes (for example, main)\nRun git merge with the name of the other branch\n\nVisually, a merge brings two lines of work back together:\ngitGraph\n  commit id: \"Start on main\"\n  branch feature/login-page\n  checkout feature/login-page\n  commit id: \"Login page work\"\n  checkout main\n  commit id: \"Other main work\"\n  merge feature/login-page id: \"Merge feature into main\"\n\nMerging a Branch Locally\nExample of merging feature/login-page into main:\n# 1. Switch to main\ngit checkout main\n\n# 2. Make sure main is up to date\ngit pull\n\n# 3. Merge the feature branch into main\ngit merge feature/login-page\n\nIf Git can combine everything automatically, you will see a success message.\nThen you can push the updated main to the remote:\ngit push\n\n\nFast-Forward vs Merge Commit (Simple View)\nYou might see terms like:\n\nFast-forward\nMerge commit\n\nYou do not need to know all the internals, but here is a simple explanation:\n\nFast-forward:\nmain had no new commits, so Git just moves the pointer forward to include your feature branch. This is the simplest case.\n\nMerge commit:\nBoth main and your feature branch had new commits. Git creates a new commit that joins both histories.\n\n\nIn both cases, the end result is:\nmain now includes the changes from feature/login-page.\n\nWhen Merging Causes Conflicts\nConflicts happen when:\n\nTwo branches changed the same lines in the same file\n\nExample:\n\nOn main, someone changes the title in home-page.md.\nOn your feature branch, you change that same title in a different way.\n\nWhen you try to merge, Git cannot choose which version is correct.\nYou will see conflict markers like:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nTitle from the branch you are merging into (for example, main)\n=======\nTitle from the branch you are merging (for example, feature/login-page)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature/login-page\n\nTo resolve:\n\nOpen the file in your editor\nDecide which text to keep (or combine both)\nRemove the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines\nSave the file\nStage and commit the resolution:\n\ngit add home-page.md\ngit commit -m &quot;Resolve merge conflict in home-page title&quot;\n\nAfter this, the merge is complete.\n\nEveryday Exampl"},"3":{"title":"Git Terms Glossary (Plain

unfamiliar terms in tools like GitHub, GitLab, or your terminal.\n\nRepository (Repo)\nWhat it means:\nA repository (or repo) is the project folder that Git is watching.\nIt contains:\n\nYour files and folders\nThe history of changes (commits)\nBranches and other Git data\n\nAnalogy:\nThink of a repo as a project binder that holds all versions of your document, not just the latest one.\n\nLocal vs Remote\nLocal repository:\nThe copy of the Git project on your own computer.\nRemote repository:\nThe copy of the Git project on a server (for example on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).\nAnalogy:\nLocal = files on your laptop.\nRemote = files stored in your team’s shared cloud drive.\nYou can think of the relationship like this:\ngraph LR;\n  Local[\"Local repo(your computer)\"]\n  Remote[\"Remote repo(server / cloud)\"]\n\n  Local -->|\"push (send changes)\"| Remote\n  Remote -->|\"pull (get changes)\"| Local\n\nClone\nWhat it means:\nTo download a full copy of a remote repository to your local computer.\nCommand example:\ngit clone https://github.com/company/project.git\n\nAnalogy:\nLike saving a shared online folder to your own computer for the first time.\n\nCommit\nWhat it means:\nA commit is a saved snapshot of your project at a point in time, with a message describing what changed.\nCommand example:\ngit commit -m &quot;Fix typo on home page&quot;\n\nAnalogy:\nLike clicking “Save a version” in a document editor and writing a short note about what you changed.\n\nCommit Message\nWhat it means:\nThe short description you write when making a commit.\nGood commit messages are:\n\nClear\nShort\nSpecific\n\nExamples:\n\n&quot;Update footer copyright year&quot;\n&quot;Add checkout button to cart page&quot;\n\n\nBranch\nWhat it means:\nA branch is a separate line of work in the same repository.\nEach branch can have:\n\nIts own commits\nIts own changes\n\nCommon branch names:\n\nmain (or master) – the main, stable branch\nfeature/login-page – a branch to build a new login page\n\nAnalogy:\nLike making a copy of a document so you can try changes without touching the original.\n\nMain (or Master) Branch\nWhat it means:\nThe primary branch of a project where the most stable version of the code lives.\nTeams often:\n\nDeploy from main to production\nProtect main with reviews and approvals\n\n\nCheckout\nWhat it means:\nTo switch to a different branch or move to a specific commit.\nExamples:\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout feature/login-page\n\nAnalogy:\nLike choosing which version of a document you want to open and edit.\n\nRemote (Origin)\nWhat it means:\nA remote is a named connection to a repository on a server.\norigin is the default name Git uses for the main remote repository.\nExample:\ngit push origin main\n\nThis means: push the main branch to the origin remote.\n\nPush\nWhat it means:\nTo send your local commits to the remote repository.\nCommand:\ngit push\n\nAnalogy:\nLike clicking “Upload” to send your updated document to a shared drive.\nSee the Pushing Code page for step-by-step details.\n\nPull\nWhat it means:\nTo download and merge new commits from the remote repository to

changes from one branch into another.\nExample:\ngit merge feature/login-page\n\nThis means: merge the feature/login-page branch into your current branch.\nAnalogy:\nLike taking edits from a draft copy and carefully adding them into the official document.\n\nMerge Conflict\nWhat it means:\nA situation where two branches changed the same part of the same file, and Git cannot decide which version to keep.\nGit marks the conflict and asks you to:\n\nOpen the file\nChoose which changes to keep (or combine them)\nSave and commit the result\n\nAnalogy:\nTwo people edit the same sentence in different ways.\nSomeone has to manually choose the final wording.\n\nPull Request / Merge Request (PR / MR)\nWhat it means:\nA pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab, Bitbucket) is a formal request to merge one branch into another, usually with:\n\nA description of the change\nA place for comments\nCode review from teammates\n\nAnalogy:\nLike asking a colleague: “Please review my edits and, if you agree, add them to the official document.”\n\nStash\nWhat it means:\nTo temporarily set aside your unfinished changes without committing them, so you can switch branches or pull updates.\nExample:\ngit stash\n\nLater you can bring those changes back with:\ngit stash pop\n\nAnalogy:\nPutting your notes into a drawer for a moment so you can work on something else, then taking them back out later.\n\nStatus\nWhat it means:\nThe current state of your working directory and staging area:\n\nWhich files changed\nWhich files are staged\nWhich branch you are on\n\nCommand:\ngit

Everyone","id":"git/","text":"Git Basics for Everyone\nGit is a tool that keeps track of changes to your files over time.\nYou can think of it like the history feature in Google Docs, but for code projects.\nWith Git you can:\n\nSave snapshots of your work (called commits)\nGo back in time if something breaks\nWork together with other people on the same project without overwriting each other\nExperiment safely on separate lines of work (called branches)\n\nHere is a simple picture of how Git connects you, your local copy, and the shared remote:\ngraph LR;\n  Developer[\"You on your computer\"]\n  LocalRepo[\"Local Git repository(on your machine)\"]\n  RemoteRepo[\"Remote Git repository(GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket)\"]\n\n  Developer -->|\"edit files\"| LocalRepo\n  LocalRepo -->|\"push changes\"| RemoteRepo\n  RemoteRepo -->|\"pull changes\"| LocalRepo\n\nSimple Story: Why Git Is Helpful\nImagine your team is writing a big document:\n\nOn Monday, you save a version called v1.\nOn Tuesday, you make changes and save v2.\nOn Wednesday, a mistake is found, and you wish you could go back to v1.\n\nWithout a system, you might have many messy files:\nproject-final.doc, project-final-FINAL.doc, project-please-use-this-one.doc.\nGit solves this by:\n\nKeeping one folder for your project\nRemembering every change inside a timeline\nLetting you move back and forward in that timeline\n\n\nCommon Things You Will Do with Git\nIn this Git section, we will walk you through:\n\nPushing code: sending your changes from your computer to a shared online place (like GitHub)\nPulling code: bringing the latest changes from the shared place down to your computer\nBranches: creating separate lines of work so you can experiment without breaking the main project\nMerging: bringing changes from one branch into another (for example, from a feature branch into main)\nGit terms: understanding simple meanings of words like commit, repository, remote, and more\n\nYou do not need to be “technical” to follow along.\nWe will use plain language and step‑by‑step instructions with examples.\n\nWhat You Need Before You Start\nTo follow the examples:\n\nGit installed on your computer (usually installed by IT or via a Git installer)\nAn account on a Git hosting service, such as:\n\nGitHub\nGitLab\nBitbucket\n\n\nA project that already uses Git (your team or company will usually provide this)\n\nIf you are not sure whether Git is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:\ngit --version\n\nIf you see a version number, Git is installed.\nIf you see an error, ask your IT team to help you install Git.\n\nHow This Guide Is Organized\nUse the navigation on the left to read topics in this order:\n\nPushing Code – how to send

the Latest Changes)","id":"git/pulling-code/","text":"Pulling Code (Getting the Latest Changes)\nPulling code means getting the newest changes from the shared online repository onto your computer.\nThink of it like:\n\nYour teammates have updated the document online.\nYou click “refresh” to download their latest version to your computer.\n\nIn Git terms:\n\nThe shared place (e.g. GitHub) is the remote repository.\nYour computer has the local repository.\ngit pull brings changes from remote → local.\n\nHere is a simple diagram of a pull:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Remote as Remote repo (GitHub / GitLab)\n  participant Local as Local repo\n  participant You as You (local)\n\n  You->>Local: git pull\n  Local->>Remote: Ask for latest commits\n  Remote-->>Local: Send new commits\n  Local-->>You: Files updated on your machine\n\nWhen Should You Pull?\nYou should run git pull:\n\nBefore you start work each day – to make sure you start from the latest version\nBefore you create a new branch – so your branch is based on recent work\nBefore you push your own changes – to avoid conflicts when others have pushed earlier\n\nPulling regularly helps keep everyone’s work in sync.\n\nBasic Command: git pull\nIn your project folder, open a terminal or command prompt and run:\ngit pull\n\nGit will:\n\nConnect to the remote repository\nDownload any new commits\nTry to automatically combine them with your local branch\n\nIf your branch is called main and the remote is origin, this is usually the same as:\ngit pull origin main\n\n\nExample: Starting Your Day\nHere’s a simple daily routine:\ncd your-project-folder\n\n# See your current branch and status\ngit status\n\n# Get the latest changes from the remote\ngit pull\n\nAfter git pull finishes:\n\nYour local files are updated\nYou see any new code or text your teammates have added\n\n\nWhat Happens If There Are No New Changes?\nIf your local branch is already up to date, Git will show a message like:\nAlready up to date.\n\nThis simply means:\n\nThere is nothing new to download\nYou are already on the latest version of that branch\n\n\nWhat If There Are New Changes?\nIf there are new commits on the remote branch, Git will:\n\nDownload them\nTry to merge them with your local branch automatically\n\nYou might see messages showing:\n\nWhich files changed\nHow many lines were added or removed\n\nExample (simplified):\nUpdating 1234567..89abcde\nFast-forward\n README.md | 5 +++--\n 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)\n\nYou can now open your files and see the latest content.\n\nWhen Pull Causes a Conflict\nSometimes, both you and a teammate edit the same part of the same file.\nWhen you run git pull, Git may not know which version to keep.\nThis is called a merge conflict.\nIn that case, Git will:\n\nStop and mark the conflict in the file\nAsk you to manually decide which change to keep (yours, theirs, or both)\n\nExample conflict markers in a file:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nYour version of the text here.\n=======\nTeammate&#x27;s version of the text here.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/main\n\nTo fix this:\n\nOpen the file in your editor\nChoose the correct text (or combine both)\nRemove the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines\nSave the file\nRun:\n\ngit add path/to/conflicted-file\ngit commit -m &quot;Resolve merge conflict in file&quot;\n\nYou will learn more about this in Branches &amp; Merging.\n\nSimple Workflow: Pull Before Push\nA safe habit is:\n\nPull first to get the latest changes\nThen push your own changes\n\nExample:\n# Get latest changes from remote\ngit pull\n\n# (If there are conflicts, resolve them and commit)\n\n# Send your new commits to remote\ngit push\n\nThis reduces the chance that your push will be rejected due to other people’s new commits.\n"},"6":{"title":"Pushing Code (Sending Your Work Online)","id":"git/pushing-code/","text":"Pushing Code (Sending Your Work Online)\nPushing code means sending your latest changes from your computer to the shared online repository\n(for example, on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).\nThink of it like:\n\nYou write some changes on your local copy of a document.\nWhen you are happy, you upload those changes so your team can see them.\n\nIn Git terms:\n\nYour computer has a local repository.\nThe shared place (e.g. GitHub) is the remote repository.\ngit push sends your changes from local → remote.\n\nVisually, pushing looks like this:\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant You as You (local)\n  participant Local as Local repo\n  participant Remote as Remote repo (GitHub / GitLab)\n\n  You->>Local: git addgit commit\n  Local->>Remote: git push\n  Remote-->>You: Confirms new commits are stored\n\nBefore You Push: The Basic Flow\nUsually, you follow these three steps:\n\nCheck what changed\nStage the changes (choose what to include)\nCommit the changes (save a snapshot)\nPush the commit(s) to the remote repository\n\nWe will walk through each step with simple examples.\n\n1. Check What Changed\nIn your project folder, open a terminal or command prompt and run:\ngit status\n\nThis shows:\n\nWhich files are new\nWhich files have been modified\nWhich files are ready to be committed\n\nExample output (simplified):\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  modified:   README.md\nUntracked files:\n  new-feature.txt\n\nThis tells you Git sees changes but you have not prepared them yet.\n\n2. Stage the Changes\nStaging means selecting which files you want to include in your next snapshot (commit).\n\nTo stage one file:\n\ngit add README.md\n\n\nTo stage all changed files in the project:\n\ngit add .\n\nAfter staging, run git status again:\ngit status\n\nYou should now see something like:\nChanges to be committed:\n  modified:   README.md\n  new file:   new-feature.txt\n\nThis means Git is ready to save these files in the next commit.\n\n3. Commit Your Changes\nA commit is like a named snapshot of your project at a point in time.\nTo create a commit, run:\ngit commit -m &quot;Add new feature description&quot;\n\n\nThe text inside quotes is your commit message.\nUse simple, clear language like:\n\n&quot;Fix typo in introduction&quot;\n&quot;Update home page content&quot;\n&quot;Add login button styling&quot;\n\n\n\nAfter you commit, your changes are now:\n\nSaved locally in your Git history\nNot yet uploaded to the shared remote repository\n\n\n4. Push Your Commit to the Remote\nTo send your commit(s) to the remote repository, run:\ngit push\n\nIn many teams, the main branch is called main or master.\nIf you’re on a different branch (for example, feature/login-page), Git will push that branch to the remote.\nExample:\ngit push origin main\n\nHere:\n\norigin is the name of the remote (usually the default)\nmain is the name of the branch you are pushing\n\nAfter this command succeeds, your teammates can see your changes online.\n\nComplete Example: From Change to Push\nImagine you updated a file called home-page.md.\nStep-by-step:\n# 1. See what changed\ngit status\n\n# 2. Stage the file\ngit add home-page.md\n\n# 3. Commit with a clear message\ngit commit -m &quot;Update home page introduction text&quot;\n\n# 4. Push to the remote repository\ngit push\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, you will see messages that your branch was pushed successfully.\n\nCommon Questions\nQ: What if git push asks for a username or password?\nA: This means Git needs to authenticate you with the remote service (like GitHub).\nFollow your company’s instructions (they may use a token, SSH key, or single sign-on).\nQ: What if git push is rejected?\nA: Often this means someone else has pushed changes before you.\nYou usually need to:\ngit pull\n\nto bring their changes down first, resolve any conflicts, then push again.\nYou can learn more about this in the Pulling Code and Branches &amp; Merging pages.\n"},"7":{"title":"Welcome","id":"index","text":"Welcome to Your Docs 🚀\nCongratulations!
